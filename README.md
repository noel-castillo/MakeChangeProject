## Make Change Project

### First week homework for Skill Distillery

### Overview

This program simulates a cash transaction interface at a register
that carries denominations of twenty dollar bills and below. Items can be
scanned into the register until all items are entered and ready for checking
out. Customer will then pay an amount, but if it is insufficient to cover
the checkout cost, then the customer may make an additional payment or request
a refund from the cashier. If the customer request a refund, then the cashier
will issue a refund and break down the denominations of the refund. Should the
amount paid exceed the checkout cost, then the cashier will issue the change
and break down the denominations.

### How to run

User will be prompted to enter the price of an item.

User can then enter the price of an additional item or enter 0 to checkout.

User will be prompted to enter the amount paid to cashier.

If amount paid is insufficient, user can make an additional payment.

User can also opt to not make additional payments and leave the store.
Once amount paid is sufficient for the checkout total, then the program
will determine whether or not change is due.

If change is due, then the total amount and proper denominations will be
outputted to the user.

Otherwise, if no change is due, then a proper message will be relayed.

### Technologies/topics used

calling a method

calling a method within a method

while loops

do while loops

if else statements

ternary operators

continue

break

casting


### Lessons

Casting to an int too often will result in loss of accuracy. Created a
separate variable whose purpose is to output data to the user and now
the variable that holds the data will not be casted and will not lose accuracy.
