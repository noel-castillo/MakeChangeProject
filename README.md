## Make Change Project

### First week homework for Skill Distillery

### Overview

This program simulates a cash transaction interface.

### How to run

User will be prompted to enter the price of an item.

User can then enter the price of an additional item or enter 0 to checkout.

User will be prompted to enter the amount paid to cashier.

If amount paid is insufficient, user can make an additional payment.

User can also opt to not make additional payments and leave the store.
Once amount paid is sufficient for the checkout total, then the program
will determine whether or not change is due.

If change is due, then the total amount and proper denominations will be
outputted to the user.

Otherwise, if no change is due, then a proper message will be relayed.

### Technologies/topics used

methods
while loops
do while loops
if else statements
ternary operators
continue
casting

### Lessons

Casting to an int too often will result in loss of accuracy. Created a
separate variable whose purpose is to output data to the user and now
the variable that holds the data will not be casted and will not lose accuracy.

Debugging skills improved
User interaction skills improved
Identifying loopholes in code improved
